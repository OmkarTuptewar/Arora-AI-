# AI Voice Assistant

Built an AI Voice Assistant: Used MERN stack, Deepgram STT/TTS, and Groq API for real-time audio processing and intelligent responses.

Real-Time Interaction: Leveraged WebSockets for seamless, low-latency audio-to-text and text-to-audio conversion.

User-Friendly UI: Created a responsive React frontend with start/stop recording and audio playback features.

End-to-End Solution: Developed a full-stack app for capturing, processing, and responding to user audio input.
